# BC Model Serialization Solution

## Problem
BC model evaluation was failing because:
- Checkpoints only saved model parameters, not the Haiku-transformed functions
- `load_checkpoint_model` returned a `LoadedModel` dataclass
- BC evaluator expected tuples/callables with the actual model functions
- JAX/Haiku functions cannot be pickled directly

## Solution Overview
Implemented a principled JAX/Haiku model serialization approach that:
1. Saves model configuration alongside parameters in checkpoints
2. Uses a model registry to recreate models from configuration
3. Reconstructs Haiku-transformed functions during loading
4. Returns models in the format expected by BC evaluator

## Implementation Details

### 1. Model Registry (`model_registry.py`)
- Central registry for model creation functions
- Maps model type identifiers to creation functions
- Supports:
  - `continuous_surrogate`: Continuous parent set models
  - `jax_unified_surrogate`: JAX unified parent set models
  - `enhanced_acquisition`: Enhanced policy networks
  - `standard_acquisition`: Standard policy networks

### 2. Updated Checkpoint Saving
- **BC Surrogate Trainer**: Now saves `model_type` and `model_config` with:
  - Model architecture parameters
  - Variable names and target variable
  - Model complexity settings
- **BC Acquisition Trainer**: Now saves `model_type` and `model_config` with:
  - Policy network parameters
  - Number of variables (if available)
  - Enhanced vs standard policy flag

### 3. Model Loading Infrastructure (`bc_model_loader.py`)
- `load_bc_surrogate_model()`: 
  - Loads checkpoint and extracts configuration
  - Recreates model using registry
  - Returns tuple: (init_fn, apply_fn, encoder_init, encoder_apply, params)
- `load_bc_acquisition_model()`:
  - Loads checkpoint and extracts configuration
  - Recreates model using registry
  - Returns callable acquisition function

### 4. BC Evaluator Updates
- Uses new model loaders instead of generic `load_checkpoint_model`
- Properly handles model reconstruction
- Maintains compatibility with existing evaluation interface

## Benefits
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only JAX/Haiku (no Orbax needed)
- **Full Model Reconstruction**: Models are completely reconstructible from checkpoints
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing checkpoint format
- **Type Safe**: Returns models in expected formats
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new model types to registry

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_bc_model_loading.py`) that verifies:
- Model registry functionality
- Checkpoint validation
- Surrogate model loading and inference
- Acquisition model loading and inference
- All tests passing âœ…

## Usage
The BC evaluation notebook should now work correctly:
1. BC models train and save checkpoints with configuration
2. BC evaluator loads checkpoints and reconstructs models
3. Models can be used for inference during evaluation

No changes needed to the notebook - the fix is transparent to users.
