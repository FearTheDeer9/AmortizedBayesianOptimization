# Fixed Model Validation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully validated that the `FixedContinuousParentSetPredictionModel` resolves the uniform output issue and can serve as a drop-in replacement for the original model.

## Validation Results

### 1. Synthetic SCM Tests

Tested on three canonical causal structures using native SCM factories:

| Structure | Description | Original Accuracy | Fixed Accuracy |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Fork | X → Y ← Z | 100% | 100% |
| Chain | X0 → X1 → X2 → X3 | 0% | 100% |
| Collider | X → Z ← Y | 100% | 100% |
| **Average** | | **66.67%** | **100%** |

Key findings:
- The original model fails completely on chain structures (outputs uniform [0.333, 0.333, 0.333, 0.0])
- The fixed model correctly identifies parent relationships in all test cases
- Training convergence is much faster with the fixed model
- The fixed model produces varied outputs based on input correlations

### 2. Compatibility Tests

All compatibility tests passed:
- ✅ **Model Signatures**: Identical initialization and call signatures
- ✅ **Output Structure**: Same dictionary keys and tensor shapes
- ✅ **Probability Properties**: Valid distributions that sum to 1.0
- ✅ **BC Infrastructure**: Works with existing BC inference functions
- ✅ **Downstream Components**: Compatible with method wrappers

## Root Cause Analysis

The original model's `ParentAttentionLayer` had a fundamental flaw:
```python
# Original (broken):
query_expanded = jnp.tile(query[None, :], (n_vars, 1))  # All rows identical!
attended = attention(query=query_expanded, ...)  # Produces identical outputs
```

The fixed model uses proper attention:
```python
# Fixed:
q = query_projection(query)  # Single query for target
k = key_projection(key_value)  # Keys for each potential parent
scores = jnp.dot(k, q) / jnp.sqrt(self.key_size)  # Different scores per parent
```

## Migration Plan

### 1. Replace Model Class
In all files that import the model, change:
```python
from causal_bayes_opt.avici_integration.continuous.model import ContinuousParentSetPredictionModel
```
To:
```python
from causal_bayes_opt.avici_integration.continuous.fixed_model import FixedContinuousParentSetPredictionModel as ContinuousParentSetPredictionModel
```

### 2. Key Files to Update
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/avici_integration/continuous/factory.py`
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/training/bc_surrogate_trainer.py`
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/training/bc_model_inference.py`
- Any notebooks using the model directly

### 3. Retrain BC Models
Since the original model couldn't learn correlations:
1. Delete existing BC checkpoints (they contain useless uniform predictors)
2. Retrain BC surrogate models with the fixed architecture
3. Monitor training to ensure varied outputs and improving accuracy

### 4. Validation Steps
Before full deployment:
1. Run a small BC training experiment
2. Verify checkpoints contain meaningful (non-uniform) parameters
3. Test BC method wrappers produce different results for different SCMs
4. Confirm improved performance in notebooks

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Correct Learning**: Model can actually learn parent-child relationships
2. **Better Performance**: 100% accuracy on test SCMs vs 66.67%
3. **Faster Convergence**: Reaches optimal performance in fewer steps
4. **No API Changes**: Drop-in replacement with identical interface
5. **Maintained Compatibility**: Works with all existing infrastructure

## Next Steps

1. Update imports to use fixed model
2. Retrain BC models
3. Verify improved performance in evaluation notebooks
4. Consider making the fixed model the default in future releases
