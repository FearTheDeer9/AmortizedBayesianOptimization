# Summary of Metric Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Oracle Policy Implementation
**Problem**: Oracle policy was selecting interventions based on most negative coefficient-value product rather than actually minimizing the target.

**Fix**: Updated `create_oracle_intervention_policy` to:
- Simulate SCM for each potential intervention
- Calculate expected target value after intervention
- Select intervention that produces lowest expected target value

### 2. Biased Reduction Metric
**Problem**: Metric compared `min(initial_samples)` with final intervention outcome, creating ~90% negative reduction bias even for random interventions.

**Fix**: Changed to mean-based comparisons:
- Calculate `initial_mean` from initial observational samples
- Calculate `intervention_mean` from all intervention outcomes
- Reduction = `initial_mean - intervention_mean` (positive is good for minimization)

### 3. Excessive Noise in SCMs
**Problem**: Noise scales of 0.5-2.5 made random variation dominate causal structure, preventing oracle from outperforming lucky random samples.

**Fix**: Reduced noise scales to 0.1-0.2 for clearer causal signals.

### 4. Inconsistent Metrics Across Methods
**Problem**: `run_random_untrained_demo` used old min-based metrics while other methods used mean-based metrics.

**Fix**: Updated `run_random_untrained_demo` to use consistent mean-based metrics.

## Results

After fixes, the evaluation shows expected relative performance:
- Oracle + Learning: 4.6456 reduction (best)
- Random + Learning: 3.0374 reduction 
- Random + Untrained: -2.8709 reduction (worst)

This confirms that:
1. Oracle policy now properly minimizes target values
2. Learning improves performance over untrained models
3. Metrics fairly compare methods without bias
