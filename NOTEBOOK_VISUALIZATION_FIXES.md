# Notebook Visualization Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-07-24

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Empty Plots in Evaluation Notebook
**Problem**: The visualization cell in `grpo_evaluation_modular.ipynb` was completing without generating any plots, showing only "âœ… Visualization complete!" with empty results.

**Root Cause**: The notebook was not properly extracting trajectory data from the evaluation results. The visualization cell was looking for data in the wrong format and not finding the trajectory information.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the visualization cell (cell-13) to:
- Properly extract trajectory data from method_results using `extract_metrics_from_experiment_result`
- Handle missing true_parents information by checking multiple sources
- Aggregate trajectory data across multiple runs
- Create both trajectory plots and summary bar plots
- Add fallback matplotlib plotting when advanced plotting functions fail

### 2. Missing F1/SHD Metrics
**Problem**: F1 and SHD metrics were not being computed for methods without learning (e.g., Random + Untrained).

**Root Cause**: These methods don't have marginal probabilities to compute structure metrics from.

**Solution**: 
- The trajectory metrics extraction now properly handles methods without marginals
- Uses default values (0.0 for F1, len(true_parents) for SHD) when no structure learning occurs
- Ensures all methods have consistent trajectory data format

### 3. Checkpoint Timestamp Loading
**Problem**: Checkpoint loading was failing with "Failed to load checkpoint: 'timestamp'" error.

**Root Cause**: The timestamp was nested in training_results in some checkpoints.

**Solution**: Updated `base_components.py` and `pipeline_interfaces.py` to check for timestamp in multiple locations:
```python
timestamp = data.get("timestamp", "unknown")
if timestamp == "unknown" and "training_results" in data:
    timestamp = data["training_results"].get("timestamp", "unknown")
```

### 4. Plot Location Confusion
**Problem**: Users couldn't find the generated plots because they were saved in unexpected locations.

**Root Cause**: Hydra was changing the working directory, causing plots to be saved in `scripts/core/experiment_plots/`.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the export cell (cell-15) to clearly report all plot locations
- Added comprehensive plot discovery that checks main directory and subdirectories
- Shows relative paths to make plots easier to find

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Visualization Cell
- Imports proper analysis functions and SCM utilities
- Extracts trajectory data for each method and run
- Handles missing data gracefully with informative messages
- Creates both trajectory and summary plots
- Shows plots inline in the notebook

### 2. Updated Export Cell  
- Lists all generated plots with their locations
- Provides clear next steps for users
- Reports if no plots were found and suggests re-running visualization

### 3. Improved Data Flow
- Updated `unified_pipeline.py` to properly create EvaluationResults
- Fixed trajectory data extraction in multiple places
- Ensured Random + Untrained method creates proper detailed_results

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the evaluation notebook cells in order
2. The visualization cell will now:
   - Show progress for each method being processed
   - Report how many runs and steps were extracted
   - Display plots inline
   - Save plots to checkpoint-specific directories

3. The export cell will clearly show where all plots are saved

## Testing the Fixes

To verify the fixes work:

1. Run evaluation with SINGLE_CHECKPOINT mode
2. Check the visualization cell output for:
   - Progress messages for each method
   - Inline plot display
   - Success messages with file paths
3. Check the export cell for complete list of plot locations
4. Navigate to the output directory to find:
   - `{checkpoint_name}/plots/trajectory_comparison.png`
   - `{checkpoint_name}/plots/performance_summary.png`

## Future Improvements

1. Add true_parents to SCM metadata during generation for easier access
2. Implement proper structure metrics for baseline methods
3. Add more informative error messages when trajectory extraction fails
4. Consider consolidating all plotting logic into a single module
