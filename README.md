# MSc Thesis

* **algorithms**: This file contains the implementatios for the different BayesOpt algorithm
* **data**: The data for the different runs of the different experiments
* **experiments**: This folder contains some experiments for the different graph structures as well as algorithms. For now it is mostly RnD
* **graphs**: This is the graph datastructure written in an object orientated way. The contains functions functions for fitting data to the graphs, as well as other functions which makes use of the dependency structure of it.
* **results**: The results for the different algorithms with different graph data structures, also has notebooks which plots all the code.
* **scripts**: The scripts that will run the experiments
* **utils**: The remaining functions for the graphs, and the algorithm. Also contains a lot of data manipulation code.
