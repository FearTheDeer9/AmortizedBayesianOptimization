# Task Plan: Unified Tensor-State Architecture Migration
## Date: 2025-01-07

## Objective
Migrate the codebase to use a unified TensorBackedAcquisitionState that eliminates representation mismatches between tensor operations (for JAX efficiency) and AcquisitionState interface (for GRPO and rewards), while following TDD principles and properly deprecating legacy code.

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists:
- `JAXAcquisitionState` in `/src/causal_bayes_opt/jax_native/state.py` - already tensor-backed!
- 24+ files using AcquisitionState interface across acquisition/, training/, and integration modules
- GRPO implementation expecting AcquisitionState objects but receiving tensor data
- Enriched trainer using tensor conversions with Mock objects (source of vmap errors)
- Comprehensive test suite with existing JAX-native tests

### What Works:
- JAX-native state architecture foundation exists with proper validation
- Test-driven development infrastructure with property-based testing
- Continuous action space (variable + value selection working correctly)
- Variable-size graph handling in policy networks (supports 3-4+ variable SCMs)
- Performance-conscious immutable data structures

### What Needs Improvement:
- **Critical Issue**: Representation conversion bottlenecks causing vmap errors in GRPO
- Mock object complexity in enriched_trainer causing AcquisitionState creation failures
- 24+ files need systematic migration to unified state representation
- Legacy deprecation process needs implementation with clear warnings
- Test coverage needs to be maintained at 90%+ throughout migration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test-Driven Foundation (TDD-First Approach)
**Goal**: Write comprehensive failing tests before any implementation

**Files Created**: 
- `tests/test_tensor_backed_acquisition_state.py` - Core functionality tests
- `tests/test_grpo_tensor_compatibility.py` - GRPO integration tests
- `tests/test_migration_compatibility.py` - Backward compatibility tests

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
**Goal**: Extend JAXAcquisitionState to provide full AcquisitionState interface

**Files Modified**:
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/jax_native/state.py` - Add TensorBackedAcquisitionState
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/acquisition/grpo.py` - Update vmap operations

### Phase 3: Critical Path Migration
**Goal**: Fix the immediate training issues in enriched_trainer

**Files Modified**:
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/training/enriched_trainer.py` - Remove Mock objects
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/acquisition/policy.py` - Ensure tensor compatibility

### Phase 4: Systematic Migration
**Goal**: Migrate all remaining files with proper deprecation

**Files to Update**: All 24+ files identified by grep search

### Phase 5: Cleanup & Validation
**Goal**: Ensure clean codebase with proper deprecation warnings

## Design Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Extend JAXAcquisitionState vs Create New Class
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Decision**: Extend existing JAXAcquisitionState to avoid duplication
**Rationale**: 
- Leverages existing tensor-backed architecture and validation
- Maintains immutability principles already implemented
- Reduces risk of introducing new bugs
- Follows DRY principle

### Decision 2: Property-Based Interface Compatibility
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Decision**: Use @property methods to provide AcquisitionState interface
**Rationale**:
- Enables gradual migration without breaking existing code
- Maintains performance by computing properties on-demand
- Follows functional programming principles (computed vs stored)
- Allows for clean deprecation path

### Decision 3: TDD Approach for Critical Infrastructure
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Decision**: Write all tests first, especially for state transitions and GRPO integration
**Rationale**:
- Prevents regression in critical training pipeline
- Ensures 90%+ coverage requirement is met
- Validates design before implementation
- Follows CLAUDE.md mandatory TDD process

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: vmap Error in GRPO Loss Computation
**Issue**: GRPO expects to vmap over tensor data but receives AcquisitionState objects
**Root Cause**: Type mismatch between enriched trainer (tensors) and GRPO (states)
**Solution**: Modify GRPO vmap operations to extract tensor components from TensorBackedAcquisitionState
**Status**: Pending implementation

### Problem 2: Mock Object Complexity
**Issue**: Mock objects in enriched_trainer fail AcquisitionState validation
**Root Cause**: Mock objects don't properly support iteration required by marginal probability computation
**Solution**: Replace Mock objects with proper TensorBackedAcquisitionState instances
**Status**: Previously partially fixed, will be fully resolved in migration

## Technical Architecture Details

### TensorBackedAcquisitionState Design
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TensorBackedAcquisitionState(JAXAcquisitionState):
    """
    Unified state combining tensor efficiency with AcquisitionState interface.
    
    Extends JAXAcquisitionState with additional tensor data and computed properties
    that provide full backward compatibility with existing AcquisitionState usage.
    """
    
    # Additional tensor data for full AcquisitionState compatibility
    posterior_logits: jnp.ndarray      # [n_parent_sets] - log probabilities  
    parent_sets: Tuple[frozenset, ...] # Parent set definitions (immutable)
    variable_names: Tuple[str, ...]    # Variable names (immutable)
    current_target: str                # Target variable name
    
    # Computed properties for AcquisitionState interface
    @property
    def posterior(self) -> ParentSetPosterior:
        """Reconstruct ParentSetPosterior from tensor data"""
        
    @property
    def buffer(self) -> ExperienceBuffer:
        """Provide ExperienceBuffer interface from tensor data"""
        
    @property
    def step(self) -> int:
        """Current step from JAXAcquisitionState.current_step"""
        
    @property
    def best_value(self) -> float:
        """Best value from JAXAcquisitionState.best_value"""
```

### Migration Strategy
1. **Interface Preservation**: All existing AcquisitionState method calls continue to work
2. **Performance Optimization**: Tensor operations remain fully JAX-compilable
3. **Gradual Transition**: Files migrated systematically with individual test validation
4. **Clean Deprecation**: Clear warnings with migration instructions and timeline

### Testing Strategy
- Property-based tests with Hypothesis for state invariants
- Integration tests for GRPO, rewards, and policy compatibility
- Performance benchmarks to ensure JAX compilation benefits
- Migration compatibility tests for all existing usage patterns

This migration will solve the fundamental representation mismatch while maintaining all existing functionality and performance characteristics.
