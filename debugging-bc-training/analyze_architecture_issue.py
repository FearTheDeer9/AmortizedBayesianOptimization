The instability is caused by:

1. **Clipping Mismatch**: Model clips log_std to [-2, 2] but the actual
   data distribution would need smaller stds to fit properly.

2. **Gradient Saturation**: When log_std hits -2.0, gradients can't 
   push it lower, causing training to compensate through mean predictions.

3. **Loss Explosion**: With fixed small std, any error in mean prediction
   causes massive MSE terms: (error/0.135)^2 can easily exceed 1000.

4. **Feedback Loop**: 
   - Model becomes confident (small std)
   - Can't adjust std due to clipping
   - Adjusts mean incorrectly
   - Loss explodes
   - Gradients become huge or zero
   - Training destabilizes

The target values are in [-0.77, 0.55] with std ~0.23, which is reasonable.
The problem is architectural, not data-related.
