The pattern is clear:

1. PERFECT ACCURACY VARIABLES:
   - X3 only appears when SCM has exactly 5 variables [X0, X1, X2, X3, X4]
   - X6 only appears when SCM has exactly 8 variables
   - X8 only appears when SCM has exactly 10 variables
   - X10 only appears when SCM has exactly 12 variables
   
   These are "signature" variables that uniquely identify SCM size!
   The model learns: "If I see 5 variables and it's not X0/X1/X2/X4, it must be X3"

2. POOR ACCURACY ON X2:
   - X2 appears in SCMs of ALL sizes (5, 8, 10, 12 variables)
   - X2 is always at index 2 in the sorted list
   - But the model might have a bias toward predicting X0 or X1
   
3. THE REAL PROBLEM:
   The model is learning SCM-size-specific patterns instead of 
   general intervention selection logic!
   
   For variables that appear in multiple SCM sizes (X0, X1, X2),
   the model struggles because it can't use size as a shortcut.

The model has learned to exploit SCM size as a feature:
- Variables unique to certain sizes get perfect accuracy (X3, X6, X8, X10)
- Variables that appear across sizes struggle (X2)
- This is overfitting to the data distribution, not learning the task

The model needs to learn intervention selection based on:
- Causal structure
- Node properties
- Trajectory context

Instead it's learning: "What variables appear in SCMs of this size?"
