From our earlier analysis:
- X0: 37.6% of targets
- X1: 37.4% of targets  
- X2: 15.8% of targets
- X3: 3.2% of targets
- X6: 3.0% of targets (probably mislabeled X4 from 12-var SCMs)
- X8: 3.0% of targets (probably mislabeled X4 from 13-var SCMs)

The model learned to just predict X0/X1 most of the time because:
- Together they're 75% of the data
- A model that always predicts X0 or X1 gets ~75% accuracy
- Our model gets 57-63%, which is WORSE than this naive strategy!

Loss of 4.8 is extremely high for a classification task with ~5-13 classes.

- Random guessing on 5 classes: -log(1/5) = 1.6

The high loss (4.8) compared to random guessing (1.6-2.6) indicates the model
is VERY CONFIDENT in WRONG predictions. This happens when:

1. There's a systematic mismatch between inputs and labels
2. The model learned a wrong pattern that it's very sure about

Given that the model achieves 57% accuracy (worse than always predicting X0/X1),
it seems the model:
- Learned to mostly predict X0/X1 (the frequent classes)
- But not even doing that optimally
- Is very confident in these wrong predictions

This points to a fundamental issue in how we're creating the training data
or calculating the loss, not just the variable sorting issue.
