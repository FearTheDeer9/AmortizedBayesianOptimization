With numerical sorting:
1. X4 consistently maps to index 4 (not 4, 5, or 6)
2. Training signal is consistent across SCM sizes
3. Loss should drop from ~4.8 to ~2-3
4. Accuracy should improve from 57% to 70-80%

The key insight: Even though "X4" doesn't appear in our data
(it was renamed to X6/X8 during demo creation), the variables
that DO appear (X0, X1, X2, X3, X6, X8) now map consistently
to their numerical indices.
