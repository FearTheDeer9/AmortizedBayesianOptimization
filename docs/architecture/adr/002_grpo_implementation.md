# ADR 002: Group Relative Policy Optimization Implementation

## Context

We need to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm for our acquisition model. Traditional approaches like PPO require a value network, which adds complexity and computational overhead.

## Decision

Implement Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) which eliminates the need for a value network by using group-based advantage estimation.

## Key Aspects

1. Group sampling: Generate multiple interventions for each state
2. Relative advantage: Normalize rewards using group statistics
3. No value network: Use group mean as baseline instead of value function
4. KL divergence: Incorporate directly into loss function for stability

## Alternatives Considered

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Pros: Well-established, extensive literature
- Cons: Requires value network, higher memory usage, more complex training

### REINFORCE with Baseline
- Pros: Simpler than PPO
- Cons: Still requires baseline estimation, less stable

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduced memory and computational requirements
- Simpler implementation with fewer components
- Better suited for learning from verifiable rewards
- More stable training process

### Negative
- Less established than PPO
- May require careful tuning of group size
- Less effective for environments with high reward variance

## Implementation Notes

- Group size should be adjusted based on available memory and problem complexity
- KL divergence coefficient is critical for controlling policy drift
- Consider batch normalization of rewards for further stability
