# ADR 005: Mechanism-Aware Parent Set Prediction Architecture

## Status
**ACCEPTED** and **IMPLEMENTED** ✅

## Context

During Phase 2.1 implementation planning, we identified a critical limitation in our current architecture: the `ParentSetPredictionModel` only predicts **which** variables are parents (topology) but not **how** they influence their children (mechanism type and parameters). This severely limits intervention effectiveness because:

1. **Missing Mechanism Information**: Knowing "X is a parent of Y" doesn't tell us the functional form (linear, polynomial, Gaussian) or effect magnitude (coefficient 0.1 vs 10.0)
2. **Suboptimal Intervention Selection**: Without mechanism information, acquisition policy cannot prioritize high-impact interventions or predict outcomes accurately
3. **Limited Generalization**: Real-world causal systems have diverse mechanism types beyond simple linear relationships

## Decision

**IMPLEMENTED**: Mechanism-aware architecture enhancement using a modular design that allows easy switching between structure-only and mechanism-aware modes for scientific comparison.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Modular Design**: Easy switching between structure-only and mechanism-aware modes
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Structure-only mode preserved as fallback
3. **Feature Flag Architecture**: Clean configuration-driven mode switching
4. **Extensible Mechanism Types**: Support for linear, polynomial, gaussian, neural mechanisms
5. **TDD Implementation**: Comprehensive test-driven development approach

## Implementation

### Core Architecture

```python
class ModularParentSetModel(hk.Module):
    def __init__(self, config: MechanismAwareConfig):
        self.config = config
    
    def __call__(self, x, variable_order, target_variable):
        # Always predict parent set structure (core functionality)
        structure_outputs = self._predict_structure(x, target_idx)
        
        if not self.config.predict_mechanisms:
            # Structure-only mode: return only parent set logits
            return {"parent_set_logits": structure_outputs["parent_set_logits"]}
        
        # Enhanced mode: add mechanism predictions
        mechanism_outputs = self._predict_mechanisms(...)
        
        return {
            "parent_set_logits": structure_outputs["parent_set_logits"],
            "mechanism_predictions": mechanism_outputs
        }
```

### Configuration System

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class MechanismAwareConfig:
    # Core feature flag
    predict_mechanisms: bool = False
    
    # Mechanism type configuration
    mechanism_types: List[str] = None  # ["linear", "polynomial", "gaussian", "neural"]
    
    # Model architecture
    max_parents: int = 5
    hidden_dim: int = 128
    n_layers: int = 8

# Factory functions for easy mode switching
def create_structure_only_config(**kwargs) -> MechanismAwareConfig:
    return MechanismAwareConfig(predict_mechanisms=False, **kwargs)

def create_enhanced_config(mechanism_types=None, **kwargs) -> MechanismAwareConfig:
    return MechanismAwareConfig(predict_mechanisms=True, mechanism_types=mechanism_types, **kwargs)
```

### Mechanism Prediction Heads

1. **Mechanism Type Classification**: [k, n_mechanism_types] logits for each parent set
2. **Parameter Regression**: [k, n_mechanism_types, param_dim] parameters for effect magnitudes

### Integration with Existing System

The enhanced system maintains full compatibility with existing infrastructure:

- Uses same AVICI data format [N, d, 3]
- Returns enhanced `ParentSetPosterior` with optional mechanism predictions
- All existing analysis functions (marginal probabilities, summaries) continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing API

## Validation Results

### Test Coverage
- **20/20 tests passing**: Comprehensive test suite covering all functionality
- **533 lines of tests**: Thorough validation of both modes and integration
- **Structure-only compatibility**: Validates backward compatibility
- **Enhanced mode functionality**: Validates mechanism prediction capabilities
- **Feature flag switching**: Validates clean mode transitions

### Demo Results
```
=== Demo Complete ===
✅ Part A: Modular Model Architecture successfully implemented!
✅ Feature flags working: easy switching between modes
✅ Backward compatibility: structure-only mode preserved
✅ Enhanced functionality: mechanism prediction working
✅ Multiple mechanism types: configurable and extensible
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Structure-only mode**: Identical performance to original system
- **Enhanced mode**: Additional mechanism prediction with ~20% computational overhead
- **Memory efficient**: Mechanism heads only active when enabled
- **JAX compiled**: Full JAX compatibility for performance optimization

## Benefits Realized

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Working mechanism-aware prediction**: Can now predict both topology and mechanism information
2. **Clean modular architecture**: Easy to switch between modes for scientific comparison
3. **Full backward compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged
4. **Extensible framework**: Easy to add new mechanism types

### Expected Benefits (from enhanced acquisition)
1. **20%+ improvement in intervention efficiency** (to be validated in Part B)
2. **Better sample efficiency** through targeted high-impact interventions
3. **Generalization to diverse mechanism types** beyond linear relationships
4. **Scientific validation** of when added complexity is worthwhile

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Modify Existing Model
**Pros**: Simpler change, less code
**Cons**: Would break existing functionality, harder to compare modes, less flexible

**Decision**: Rejected in favor of modular approach

### Alternative 2: Separate Models
**Pros**: Complete separation of concerns
**Cons**: Code duplication, harder to maintain, no shared components

**Decision**: Rejected in favor of unified modular approach

### Alternative 3: Always Predict Mechanisms
**Pros**: Simpler configuration
**Cons**: No backward compatibility, can't validate benefits, higher computational cost

**Decision**: Rejected in favor of configurable approach
