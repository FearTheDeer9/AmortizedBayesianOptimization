# ADR 006: Mechanism-Aware Architecture Integration

## Status
**IMPLEMENTED** âœ… - Architecture Enhancement Pivot - Part C Complete

## Context

Following the successful implementation of mechanism-aware parent set prediction (Part A) and hybrid reward systems (Part B), we needed to integrate these enhancements into the existing ACBO pipeline to create a cohesive mechanism-aware system.

The integration required:
1. **Enhanced AcquisitionState** - Include mechanism predictions and uncertainties
2. **Upgraded Policy Network** - Use mechanism information for intervention selection  
3. **End-to-end Integration** - Ensure all components work together seamlessly
4. **Backward Compatibility** - Maintain structure-only mode for comparison

## Decision

**Implement comprehensive integration of mechanism-aware features while preserving backward compatibility.**

### Design Principles
1. **Graceful Degradation** - System works without mechanism features available
2. **Feature Flags** - Clean switching between structure-only and mechanism-aware modes
3. **Rich State Representation** - AcquisitionState includes all necessary context
4. **Enhanced Decision Making** - Policy network leverages mechanism information
5. **Comprehensive Testing** - End-to-end validation of integration

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced AcquisitionState

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AcquisitionState:
    # Core components (unchanged)
    posterior: ParentSetPosterior
    buffer: ExperienceBuffer
    best_value: float
    current_target: str
    step: int
    metadata: pyr.PMap[str, Any] = pyr.m()
    
    # Mechanism-aware enhancement (Part C)
    mechanism_predictions: Optional[List[MechanismPrediction]] = None
    mechanism_uncertainties: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None
    
    # Derived properties (enhanced)
    uncertainty_bits: float = field(init=False)
    buffer_statistics: BufferStatistics = field(init=False)
    marginal_parent_probs: Dict[str, float] = field(init=False)
    mechanism_confidence: Dict[str, float] = field(init=False)  # New
```

**Key Features:**
- **Optional Mechanism Data** - None when mechanism features unavailable
- **Computed Confidence** - Derived from mechanism predictions and uncertainties
- **Rich Insights** - `get_mechanism_insights()` method for policy decision making
- **Backward Compatibility** - Works identically without mechanism predictions

### Enhanced Policy Network

**Variable Selection Enhancement:**
```python
def _variable_selection_head(self, state_emb, state):
    # Original features (preserved)
    marginal_probs = [state.marginal_parent_probs.get(var, 0.0) for var in variable_order]
    uncertainty_features = 1.0 - 2.0 * jnp.abs(marginal_probs - 0.5)
    
    # Mechanism-aware features (Part C enhancement)
    mechanism_confidence_features = [state.mechanism_confidence.get(var, 0.0) for var in variable_order]
    predicted_effects = [abs(mechanism_insights['predicted_effects'].get(var, 0.0)) for var in variable_order]
    high_impact_indicators = [1.0 if var in mechanism_insights['high_impact_variables'] else 0.0 for var in variable_order]
    
    # Enhanced feature vector [n_vars, hidden_dim + 8]
    context_features = jnp.stack([
        marginal_probs, uncertainty_features, uncertainty_bits,
        best_value_feat, step_feat,
        mechanism_confidence_features, predicted_effects, high_impact_indicators
    ], axis=1)
```

**Value Selection Enhancement:**
```python
def _value_selection_head(self, state_emb, state):
    # Original optimization features (preserved)
    opt_progress = state.get_optimization_progress()
    progress_features = jnp.full((n_vars, 4), jnp.array([...]))
    
    # Mechanism-based features (Part C enhancement)
    predicted_coefficients = [abs(mechanism_insights['predicted_effects'].get(var, 1.0)) for var in variable_order]
    mechanism_uncertainties = [1.0 - state.mechanism_confidence.get(var, 0.5) for var in variable_order]
    
    # Enhanced feature vector [n_vars, hidden_dim + 7]
    augmented_features = jnp.concatenate([
        state_emb, best_value_feature, progress_features, mechanism_features
    ], axis=1)
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. **Separate Mechanism-Aware Pipeline**
**Pros**: No complexity in existing code, clear separation
**Cons**: Code duplication, maintenance burden, no gradual migration path

**Decision**: Rejected - Integration approach provides better user experience

### 2. **Runtime Mode Switching**
**Pros**: Dynamic switching between modes
**Cons**: Complex state management, potential for inconsistencies

**Decision**: Rejected - Creation-time mode selection is cleaner and safer

### 3. **Inheritance-Based Architecture**
**Pros**: Clear object-oriented design
**Cons**: Less functional, harder to compose, JAX compilation issues

**Decision**: Rejected - Functional approach with optional fields is more robust

## Migration Path

### For Existing Code
1. **No changes required** - Structure-only mode is default
2. **Opt-in enhancement** - Add mechanism predictions to enable features
3. **Gradual adoption** - Components can be upgraded independently

### For New Development
1. **Recommend mechanism-aware mode** - Better performance when available
2. **Fallback design** - Always handle absence of mechanism features
3. **Feature detection** - Use `MECHANISM_AWARE_AVAILABLE` flag
