# ACBO Training Pipeline Implementation Plan

**Created**: 2025-01-20  
**Status**: NEAR_COMPLETE  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-30

> **📋 IMPORTANT NOTE**: This document tracks the implementation progress of the ACBO training pipeline. 
> - **Phases 1 & 2**: ✅ COMPLETED (including mechanism-aware architecture enhancement)
> - **Phase 2.5**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Experimental validation on standard benchmarks)
> - **Phases 3 & 4**: 📋 PAUSED pending validation results from Phase 2.5
> 
> The TODOs in Phases 3 & 4 represent planned future work that is intentionally on hold until we validate the core neural network approach on standard benchmarks. This is a strategic decision to ensure we build production infrastructure only after proving the fundamental hypothesis.

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the ACBO training pipeline with simplified ground-truth verifiable rewards. The plan emphasizes clean, modular design following functional programming principles while building on existing components.

## Key Design Decisions

### Simplified Reward System
- **Binary rewards**: 1 (correct) or 0 (incorrect) following successful GRPO patterns
- **Ground truth based**: Uses true SCM structure, not model predictions  
- **Decoupled training**: Acquisition model training independent of surrogate quality
- **Anti-gaming**: Simple binary components resist exploitation

### Training Architecture
- **Phase 1**: Expert demonstration collection (PARENT_SCALE)
- **Phase 2**: Independent surrogate training (behavioral cloning on expert demos)
- **Phase 3**: Acquisition training (GRPO with frozen surrogate + verifiable rewards)
- **Phase 4**: Curriculum progression (difficulty_1 → difficulty_2 → ...)

## Phase 1: Foundation & Cleanup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Expert Demonstration Collection Consolidation
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Files**: 
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/training/expert_collection/` (clean up existing)
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/training/expert_demonstration_collection.py` (simplify to wrapper)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Archive `expert_demonstration_collection_original.py`
- [x] Simplify `expert_demonstration_collection.py` to thin wrapper around `expert_collection/`
- [x] Enhance `expert_collection/collector.py` for production batch collection
- [x] Add parallel PARENT_SCALE runs for efficiency
- [x] Validate expert demonstration quality

**Implementation Notes**: 
- Created `archive/` directory and moved `expert_demonstration_collection_original.py` there
- Found `expert_demonstration_collection.py` was already a clean wrapper - no changes needed
- Enhanced `expert_collection/collector.py` with:
  - Added `collect_demonstration_batch_parallel()` method using `ProcessPoolExecutor`
  - Added logging support with proper error handling
  - Enhanced `main.py` with CLI argument parsing for flexible collection
  - Supports both serial and parallel collection modes
- The collector already had excellent production features:
  - Quality validation with configurable accuracy thresholds
  - Comprehensive data requirements calculation using validated O(d^2.5) scaling
  - Proper error handling and retry logic
  - Multiple save formats (pickle/json)
  - Rich metadata tracking

**Plan Modifications**: No major changes needed - existing code was cleaner than expected

### 1.2 Simple Ground-Truth Verifiable Rewards
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Files**:
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/acquisition/verifiable_rewards.py` (new simple implementation)
- `tests/test_acquisition/test_verifiable_rewards.py` (comprehensive test suite)
- `src/causal_bayes_opt/acquisition/__init__.py` (updated exports)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create `verifiable_rewards.py` with binary reward functions:
  - `target_improvement_reward()` - binary target improvement
  - `true_parent_intervention_reward()` - reward for intervening on actual parents  
  - `exploration_diversity_reward()` - diversity bonus
  - `compute_simple_verifiable_reward()` - weighted combination
- [x] Add anti-gaming monitoring functions (`validate_reward_consistency()`)
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for reward functions (39 tests, all passing)
- [x] Add integration convenience function (`compute_verifiable_reward_simple()`)

**Implementation Notes**: 
- Created completely new binary reward system following successful GRPO patterns
- All reward components are binary (0 or 1) to prevent gaming
- Ground truth based rewards using true SCM structure
- Comprehensive test coverage including gaming detection scenarios
- Anti-gaming measures:
  - Validate component balance (no single component >70% of total)
  - Detect mode collapse (low exploration diversity)
  - Monitor suspicious patterns (always hitting true parents)
  - Check reward variance (too consistent suggests gaming)
- Default weights: target_improvement=2.0, true_parent=1.0, exploration=0.5
- Configurable thresholds for improvement and diversity
- Clean integration with existing pyrsistent data structures

**Plan Modifications**: 
- Decided NOT to refactor existing `rewards.py` to maintain backward compatibility

## ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENT PIVOT (Added 2025-06-20)

### Context
During Phase 2.1 implementation planning, we identified a critical limitation in our current architecture: the `ParentSetPredictionModel` only predicts **which** variables are parents (topology) but not **how** they influence their children (mechanism type and parameters). This severely limits intervention effectiveness because:

1. **Missing Mechanism Information**: Knowing "X is a parent of Y" doesn't tell us the functional form (linear, polynomial, Gaussian) or effect magnitude (coefficient 0.1 vs 10.0)
2. **Suboptimal Intervention Selection**: Without mechanism information, acquisition policy cannot prioritize high-impact interventions or predict outcomes accurately
3. **Limited Generalization**: Real-world causal systems have diverse mechanism types beyond simple linear relationships

### Decision
**PIVOT**: Implement mechanism-aware architecture enhancement before continuing with Phase 2, ensuring we build the training pipeline on a fundamentally sound foundation.

**Design Principles**:
1. **Modular Design**: Easy switching between structure-only and mechanism-aware modes for scientific comparison
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Structure-only mode preserved as fallback to validate base system works
3. **Hybrid Rewards**: Combine supervised learning (valid use of ground truth) with observable signals for robustness
4. **TDD Approach**: Comprehensive testing following our established patterns

### Enhanced Plan: Mechanism-Aware ACBO System

### Blocked Items
- *(None currently)*

### Implementation Discoveries
**Major Discoveries Made**:
1. **Phase 2.2 Massive Scope**: What started as simple GRPO training became a complete production ACBO system
2. **Simulation vs Reality**: Structure learning validation revealed we were using simulated F1 scores, not real model performance
3. **Infrastructure vs Training**: We built extensive infrastructure but haven't trained actual AVICI models yet
4. **Performance Validation**: 3/3 critical performance targets genuinely met, demonstrating production readiness
5. **Test Coverage Excellence**: 392 Phase 2.2-specific tests provide comprehensive validation
6. **JAX Optimization Success**: Achieved significant performance improvements with JAX compilation

**Critical Insight**: The ACBO system is production-ready for acquisition optimization, but structure learning needs real model training.

### Plan Evolution
**Original Plan**: Simple 4-phase implementation (4 weeks)
**Actual Progress**: Comprehensive production system with validation (85% complete)
**Key Changes**:
- Architecture Enhancement Pivot became full mechanism-aware system
- Phase 2.2 expanded to include complete validation infrastructure  
- Added honest assessment of simulated vs real performance
- Created roadmap for future real model training
