# Visual Guide for Interpreting Benchmark Results

This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and interpreting the visualizations produced by the benchmarking framework.

## Introduction

The benchmarking framework generates various visualizations to help interpret and analyze the performance of different causal discovery and optimization methods. This guide will help you understand each type of visualization and how to extract meaningful insights from them.

## Causal Discovery Benchmark Visualizations

### 1. Bar Charts of Structural Metrics

![SHD Bar Chart Example](../assets/shd_bar_chart_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **X-axis**: Different methods being compared
- **Y-axis**: Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) score (lower is better)
- **Error bars**: Standard deviation across multiple test graphs

**How to Interpret:**
- Methods with lower SHD scores more accurately recover the true graph structure
- Shorter error bars indicate more consistent performance across different graphs
- Large differences between methods suggest meaningful performance distinctions
- Consider the trade-off between precision and recall when evaluating methods

### 2. Precision-Recall Trade-off

![Precision-Recall Example](../assets/precision_recall_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **X-axis**: Recall (proportion of true edges recovered)
- **Y-axis**: Precision (proportion of predicted edges that are correct)
- **Points**: Different methods or parameter settings
- **Curves**: Methods with tunable parameters showing precision-recall trade-off

**How to Interpret:**
- Methods in the top-right corner (high precision, high recall) are best
- Methods along the curve show different trade-offs between precision and recall
- Distance from the random baseline (dotted line) indicates performance gain
- Consider your application's priorities (false positives vs. false negatives)

### 3. Confusion Matrix Visualization

![Confusion Matrix Example](../assets/confusion_matrix_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **True Positive (TP)**: Edges correctly identified
- **False Positive (FP)**: Edges incorrectly added
- **False Negative (FN)**: Edges incorrectly omitted
- **True Negative (TN)**: Non-edges correctly identified

**How to Interpret:**
- High TP and TN counts with low FP and FN counts indicate good performance
- A high FP count indicates the method tends to add spurious edges
- A high FN count indicates the method misses true causal relationships
- The balance between FP and FN reflects the method's inherent bias

## Causal Bayesian Optimization Benchmark Visualizations

### 1. Optimization Trajectory Plots

![Optimization Trajectory Example](../assets/optimization_trajectory_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **X-axis**: Iterations or evaluations
- **Y-axis**: Objective value (higher is better for maximization)
- **Lines**: Different methods' performance over time
- **Shaded regions**: Confidence intervals across multiple runs

**How to Interpret:**
- Steeper initial slopes indicate faster convergence
- Higher final values indicate better optimization performance
- Crossing lines show where one method outperforms another
- Tight confidence intervals indicate consistent performance

### 2. Intervention Value Distributions

![Intervention Value Distribution Example](../assets/intervention_value_distribution_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **X-axis**: Possible values for the intervention
- **Y-axis**: Observed or predicted outcomes
- **Distributions**: Outcome distributions under different interventions
- **Vertical lines**: Selected intervention values by different methods

**How to Interpret:**
- Peaks in the distribution indicate high-value regions for interventions
- Methods selecting interventions near these peaks are more effective
- Width of distributions indicates uncertainty in outcomes
- Overlapping distributions suggest similar effects from different interventions

### 3. Improvement Ratio Comparisons

![Improvement Ratio Example](../assets/improvement_ratio_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **X-axis**: Different methods being compared
- **Y-axis**: Improvement ratio over random baseline or initial values
- **Bar color**: Different benchmark problems or graph types

**How to Interpret:**
- Higher ratios indicate better performance relative to the baseline
- Consistent performance across different colors indicates robustness
- Methods with high variance across problems suggest sensitivity to problem structure
- Consider both average performance and consistency across problems

## Scalability Benchmark Visualizations

### 1. Scaling Curves

![Scaling Curves Example](../assets/scaling_curves_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **X-axis**: Problem size (usually number of nodes)
- **Y-axis**: Runtime or memory usage (log scale)
- **Lines**: Different methods' scaling behavior
- **Dashed lines**: Fitted complexity models (e.g., O(n²), O(n³))

**How to Interpret:**
- Steeper slopes indicate worse scaling behavior
- Parallel lines suggest similar complexity classes
- Points where lines cross indicate size thresholds where one method becomes preferable
- Consider practical limits (horizontal dotted lines) for deployment constraints

### 2. Complexity Heatmaps

![Complexity Heatmap Example](../assets/complexity_heatmap_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **X-axis**: Problem size (number of nodes)
- **Y-axis**: Different methods
- **Color**: Performance metric (e.g., runtime, memory usage, or accuracy)
- **Intensity**: Magnitude of the metric (darker typically means worse)

**How to Interpret:**
- Methods with fewer dark cells as size increases scale better
- Rapid color changes indicate transition points in scaling behavior
- Consider the trade-off between performance (accuracy) and resource usage
- White cells might indicate timeout or memory overflow

## Benchmark Runner Multi-Method Comparisons

### 1. Radar Charts for Multi-Metric Comparison

![Radar Chart Example](../assets/radar_chart_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **Axes**: Different performance metrics (SHD, precision, recall, runtime, etc.)
- **Polygons**: Different methods' performance profiles
- **Distance from center**: Better performance on that metric

**How to Interpret:**
- Larger polygons indicate better overall performance
- Shape differences highlight trade-offs between metrics
- Look for methods with good coverage of your priority metrics
- Consider the relative importance of each metric for your application

### 2. Method Ranking Tables

![Ranking Table Example](../assets/ranking_table_example.png)

**What You're Looking At:**
- **Rows**: Different methods
- **Columns**: Different benchmarks or metrics
- **Values**: Performance rank (1 is best) or statistical significance group

**How to Interpret:**
- Methods with more 1s and 2s are generally superior
- Methods in the same significance group (e.g., "A") are not statistically different
- Methods consistently in higher-ranked groups are more robust
- Consider weighted rankings based on your application priorities

## Best Practices for Reporting Benchmark Results

1. **Always include baseline methods** for context and comparison
2. **Report multiple metrics** to provide a complete performance picture
3. **Include statistical significance** where appropriate
4. **Show scaling behavior** for practical deployment considerations
5. **Report hardware specifications** used for timing-based metrics
6. **Consider real-world relevance** of synthetic benchmark problems
7. **Highlight trade-offs** between different performance aspects
8. **Be transparent about limitations** in the evaluation

## Customizing Visualizations

The benchmarking framework allows for customization of visualizations through parameters:

```python
# Customize CausalDiscoveryBenchmark plots
benchmark.plot_results(
    metrics=["shd", "precision", "recall"],  # Select metrics to display
    title="My Custom Title",                 # Set custom title
    save_path="my_custom_plot.png",          # Save to file
    figsize=(15, 8),                         # Custom figure size
    color_palette="Set2"                     # Custom color palette
)

# Customize ScalabilityBenchmark plots
benchmark.plot_scaling_curves(
    metric="runtime",                        # Select metric to plot
    log_scale=True,                          # Use logarithmic scale
    include_models=["model1", "model2"],     # Filter models to include
    save_path="scaling_curves.png"           # Save to file
)
```

## Conclusion

Effective interpretation of benchmark results requires understanding both the visualizations and the underlying metrics. This guide should help you extract meaningful insights from the benchmarking framework's output and make informed decisions about which methods are most suitable for your specific causal discovery or optimization tasks.

When reporting results from the benchmarking framework, remember to provide sufficient context and highlight the trade-offs between different performance aspects to give a complete picture of method performance.
