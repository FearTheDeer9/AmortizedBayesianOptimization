BC Checkpoint Loader Cell

Insert this code into a new cell after Cell 4 (Training Configuration) 
to skip training and load from existing checkpoints.

This allows you to:
1. Skip Cells 5-6 (Surrogate and Acquisition Training)
2. Jump directly to Cell 7 (Model Loading & Validation)
3. Continue with the rest of the notebook normally
