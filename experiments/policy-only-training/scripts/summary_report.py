    The GRPO model was learning the correct structure (X1 → X2) but not
    fully exploiting it. Intervention values stayed in a narrow range:
    
    • Range utilized: 44% ([-4.32, 0.085] out of [-5, 5])
    • Performance: 54% of optimal (-3.98 vs optimal -7.5)
    • Correct structure identified: ✅ 
    • Optimal exploitation: ❌

    1. SCALE: More training episodes/interventions might reduce noise

       → Created simplified policy without channel statistics

    1. Created test_scaled_training.py

       - Tracks performance trajectory
       
    2. Created simple_permutation_invariant_policy.py
       - Removes channel statistics extraction
       - Simpler direct processing
       - Supports both fixed and learned std
       
    3. Updated existing policies for fixed std:
       - permutation_invariant_alternating_policy.py ✅
       - clean_policy_factory.py ✅
       - unified_grpo_trainer.py ✅
       
    4. Created comparison scripts:
       - compare_architectures.py (full comparison)
       - quick_comparison.py (reduced scale)
       - test_policy_configs.py (config validation)

    The model correctly learns WHAT to intervene on (X1) but struggles
    with HOW MUCH to intervene. This suggests the value head needs
    improvement, not the variable selection head.
    
    Fixed std with appropriate scaling (proportional to variable range)
    may help by:
    1. Removing optimization burden from std learning
    2. Ensuring consistent exploration
    3. Focusing learning on mean prediction only

    2. Compare results focusing on:
       - X1 range utilization (target: >80%)

    • Soft tanh mapping preserves gradients ✅
