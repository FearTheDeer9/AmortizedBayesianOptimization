# Causal Structure Learning MVP: Continuation Prompt

## Current Project Status

We've successfully completed Tasks 1-6 of our Causal Graph Structure Learning MVP implementation, and we're now ready to proceed with Task 7: Visualization and Results Analysis.

### Key Accomplishments:

1. **Environment Setup and Scaffolding (Task 1)**: Completed with appropriate project structure and configuration management.

2. **Graph Generation and SCM Implementation (Task 2)**: Implemented RandomDAGGenerator and LinearSCMGenerator with proper functionality.

3. **Data Generation and Processing (Task 3)**: Created comprehensive utilities for generating both observational and interventional data.

4. **Neural Network Model Implementation (Task 4)**: Implemented SimpleGraphLearner with MLP-based architecture for causal structure learning.

5. **Training and Evaluation Functions (Task 5)**: Created extensive training utilities with proper metrics for evaluating graph structure recovery.

6. **Progressive Intervention Loop (Task 6)**: Successfully implemented the progressive intervention mechanism with both strategic and random acquisition strategies.

### Most Recent Finding:

In our experiments comparing intervention strategies, we've made a surprising and significant discovery: random intervention strategies often outperform strategic (uncertainty-based) approaches in causal graph structure learning. Specifically:

- For small graphs (3 nodes), random interventions sometimes achieved perfect graph recovery
- For medium graphs (4 nodes, 5 iterations), random interventions consistently outperformed strategic ones:
  - Random achieved 93.75% accuracy vs 87.5% for strategic
  - Random SHD of 1 vs 2 for strategic
  - Random F1 score of 0.8 vs 0.5 for strategic
- For large graphs (6 nodes, 3 iterations), both strategies struggled (0% precision/recall)

This unexpected finding challenges conventional wisdom that strategic intervention selection should outperform random exploration. We've documented our analysis in `memory-bank/random-vs-strategic-interventions.md`.

### Critical Insight - Potential Model Bias:

Upon closer examination of the metrics, we've identified a potential critical issue: **the model appears to be predominantly predicting "no edge" for most or all cases**. Evidence for this includes:

- Consistently high true negative (TN) counts compared to true positives
- High accuracy despite very low precision/recall in larger graphs (77.78% accuracy with 0% precision/recall)
- The model achieving reasonable accuracy while failing to recover most edges

This suggests that:
1. Our sparsity regularization may be too strong, causing the model to heavily favor predicting no edges
2. The apparent superior performance of random interventions might be due to random chance rather than better exploration
3. The uncertainty-based acquisition might be failing because there's little uncertainty when the model is confidently (but incorrectly) predicting "no edge" everywhere

## Next Steps: Task 7 - Visualization and Results Analysis

Task 7 involves creating comprehensive visualization utilities and analysis tools for our causal structure learning results. This includes:

1. Implementing visualization functions for both true and learned graphs
2. Creating utilities for plotting learning progress metrics over iterations
3. Developing comparative analysis tools for different intervention strategies
4. Implementing result saving and documentation utilities
5. **Investigating why random interventions outperform strategic ones in certain cases**
6. **Developing tools to analyze when each strategy is most appropriate**
7. **Addressing the "no edge prediction" bias:**
   - **Add visualizations of learned adjacency matrices before and after thresholding**
   - **Analyze the model's edge probability distributions**
   - **Experiment with reducing the sparsity regularization weight**
   - **Consider balanced accuracy or F1 score as the main evaluation metric**
   - **Evaluate both strategies with these adjustments**

## Development Requirements

### 1. Sequential Thinking Approach (MANDATORY)

**ALL** development must use the Sequential Thinking MCP approach to break down complex problems:

1. **Start with a clear problem definition**
2. **Decompose the problem** into logical steps
3. **Identify dependencies** between steps
4. **Consider alternate approaches** before implementation
5. **Anticipate challenges** and prepare solutions
6. **Validate each step** before proceeding

Sequential Thinking ensures thoughtful, systematic development and should be used for ALL implementation tasks.

### 2. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All functional code MUST follow TDD principles:
- Write tests BEFORE implementation
- Run tests frequently during development
- Provide evidence of test execution with results
- Ensure high test coverage
- A feature is only "done" when all tests pass

### 3. Memory Bank Documentation

All progress must be documented in the Memory Bank:
- Update `implementation-plan.md` with task status changes
- Record completed work in `progress.md` with timestamps
- Document components in `component-registry.md`
- Update `architecture.md` when adding new components

### 4. Component Registry First

Before implementing ANY new code:
- ALWAYS check the Component Registry first
- Understand existing components and their interfaces
- Follow established patterns and designs
- Avoid duplicating existing functionality
- Update the Component Registry after implementing new components

## Specific Task Instructions

For Task 7, please:

1. Implement visualization functions for comparing true and learned graphs
2. Create functions for plotting learning curves of various metrics
3. Implement tools for comparing different intervention strategies
4. Add utilities for saving and documenting experiment results
5. Add comprehensive tests for all new functionality
6. Update all memory bank files with the new components and progress

## Remember

- Use Sequential Thinking for ALL development tasks
- Write tests BEFORE implementing code
- Check the Component Registry before creating new components
- Follow established patterns and interfaces
- Document ALL new components

This approach ensures high-quality, maintainable code that integrates seamlessly with our existing codebase.
