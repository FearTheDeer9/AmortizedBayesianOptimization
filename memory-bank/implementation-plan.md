## Research Approach

This project implements Amortized Causal Discovery (ACD) within a Causal Bayesian Optimization framework. The approach uses neural networks to learn both causal graph structures and dynamics models from data, enabling scalability to larger graphs that wouldn't be feasible with traditional methods.
