# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for our **Causal Graph Structure Learning MVP** based on the new, urgent direction. The MVP will demonstrate that neural networks can learn causal graph structures from observational and interventional data.

## Priority: MVP Causal Graph Structure Learning

Our immediate focus is developing this MVP to demonstrate progressive learning of causal graph structure through iterative interventions using a simple neural network approach.

## MVP Implementation Progress Update (July 2024)

- The MVP implementation is ongoing. Task 1 is complete. Task 2 is partially complete (RandomDAGGenerator done, LinearSCMGenerator in-progress; debugging node name/ID mismatch).
- Next step: finalize debugging of LinearSCMGenerator, then proceed with data generation and model implementation.
