# Expert Technical Questions

## Q6: Should we remove the silent fallback behaviors in GRPOTrainingManager that return mock results when training fails?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (silent failures mask real training issues and prevent proper debugging)

## Q7: For reward component validation, should we implement the zero-out test you mentioned by creating separate validation functions for each reward component?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (component isolation is needed to validate optimization pressure works correctly)

## Q8: Should we fix the enhanced policy network integration issues before creating validation tests, or create simple validation tests first with basic networks?
**Default if unknown:** Create simple validation tests first (establish baseline before fixing complex integration)

## Q9: The reward weights currently favor optimization (1.0) over structure discovery (0.5) - should we test with balanced weights (e.g., both 1.0) for validation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (balanced testing helps validate both objectives work properly)

## Q10: Should we prioritize fixing the extensive test failures in tests/test_training/ as part of this validation effort?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (working tests are essential for validating that fixes actually work)
