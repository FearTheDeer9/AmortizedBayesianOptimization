# Expert Technical Answers

## Q6: Should we remove the silent fallback behaviors in GRPOTrainingManager that return mock results when training fails?
**Answer:** Yes - remove silent failures to expose real training issues for proper debugging

## Q7: For reward component validation, should we implement the zero-out test you mentioned by creating separate validation functions for each reward component?
**Answer:** Yes - create component isolation validation functions to test optimization pressure for each reward component

## Q8: Should we fix the enhanced policy network integration issues before creating validation tests, or create simple validation tests first with basic networks?
**Answer:** Yes - create simple validation tests with basic networks first to establish baseline before fixing enhanced integration

## Q9: The reward weights currently favor optimization (1.0) over structure discovery (0.5) - should we test with balanced weights (e.g., both 1.0) for validation?
**Answer:** Yes - test with balanced weights. Important insight: current optimization reward is binary and relative-improvement based, which could cause agent to avoid optimal interventions once found. Should design more objective, SCM-based continuous reward that's less reliant on prior interventions.

## Q10: Should we prioritize fixing the extensive test failures in tests/test_training/ as part of this validation effort?
**Answer:** Yes for fixing test failures, and yes for including objective continuous reward design. Important note: ensure tests are not outdated and focus on genuinely important sanity checks with merit.
