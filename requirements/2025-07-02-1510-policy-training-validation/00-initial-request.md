# Initial Request

**Slug**: policy-training-validation

## User Request

Now, given the changes we made to the policy network, let's validate that the changes we made work and make sense (i.e is the new target reward "actually" more reasonable? how can it be hacked? does our normalization scheme make sense? If all these changes make sense let's proceed by setting up the trial short train runs and if these also show good progress we can finalize this sprint by preparing the conf for full policy model training. Note that I want you to actually run the tests you write, as mentioned in our CLAUDE.md file (rather than to just write them and expect they pass)

## Context from Previous Work

- Recently implemented major changes to GRPO policy training system
- Fixed silent failure modes in training manager
- Designed new continuous SCM-objective optimization reward system
- Created component validation framework for testing individual reward components
- Built validation infrastructure with proper state tensor creation
- Need to validate these changes work correctly before full training runs
- Emphasis on actually running tests rather than just writing them
