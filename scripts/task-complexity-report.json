      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Reliable DAG Generation",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a reliable DAG generation method in GraphFactory into specific subtasks covering: 1) Method signature and integration with existing code, 2) Core algorithm for generating acyclic graphs with ordered nodes, 3) Edge probability implementation, and 4) Testing and validation of the DAG properties.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a specific algorithm with clear constraints. The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding graph theory concepts (DAGs) and implementing a reliable generation method. The task has well-defined requirements but needs careful implementation to ensure the acyclicity property is maintained."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Task Family Generation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the task family generation function into subtasks covering: 1) Module and function structure setup, 2) Edge weight variation implementation, 3) Structure variation while preserving DAG properties, 4) Node function variation implementation, and 5) Integration testing with the existing framework.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves implementing three different variation types for generating related tasks. Each variation type requires different algorithms and careful implementation to maintain valid SCM properties. The task also requires creating a new module and ensuring compatibility with the existing codebase."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration of the StructuralCausalModel implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Review and understand the existing SCM implementation, 2) Implement or extend the required methods (sample_data, perform_intervention, get_adjacency_matrix), 3) Update the example workflow to use the SCM implementation, and 4) Test the integration with sample DAGs.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating an existing implementation but may require extending it with new functionality. Understanding the current implementation and ensuring it meets all requirements adds complexity. The integration needs to be seamless with the example workflow."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the core MetaCBO logic into subtasks covering: 1) GP model fitting and updating, 2) Acquisition function implementation for intervention selection, 3) CausalExpectedImprovement implementation, 4) Causal effect estimation using backdoor adjustment, 5) Intervention evaluation logic, and 6) Integration with BoTorch for optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This is a highly complex task involving multiple sophisticated components: Bayesian optimization, Gaussian processes, causal inference, and integration with external libraries. Each component requires deep understanding of both the theoretical concepts and implementation details. The task forms the core functionality of the MetaCBO system."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration of TaskRepresentation and MAML implementations into subtasks covering: 1) Review and understand the existing TaskRepresentation implementation, 2) Review and understand the existing MAML implementation, 3) Adapt the implementations to work with causal structures and task embeddings, 4) Update the example workflow to use these implementations, and 5) Test the integration with sample task families.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integrating two complex components (TaskRepresentation and MAML) that may have their own intricate implementations. Understanding these implementations and ensuring they work together correctly with causal structures adds significant complexity. The meta-learning aspect requires careful handling of inner and outer loop updates."

      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing visualization methods which are moderately complex. While the visualization logic itself is straightforward using libraries like matplotlib and NetworkX, ensuring the visualizations are meaningful and correctly represent the underlying data requires careful implementation. The task is well-defined with clear requirements."

      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating all previous components and ensuring they work together seamlessly. The complexity comes from potential integration issues and the need to validate the entire system end-to-end. Comprehensive testing and documentation are required to ensure the workflow is robust and usable."
