# Completed Tasks and Future Work

## Completed Tasks

1. **Task 7.4: Create comprehensive documentation (Done ✅)**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the benchmarking framework
   - Added detailed explanations of key components and their interactions
   - Provided usage examples for different scenarios
   - Included clear guidelines for extending the benchmarks

2. **Task 8.2: Create Full Amortized ACD Pipeline Demo (Done ✅)**
   - Fixed and improved full_acd_pipeline_demo.py to run successfully
   - Key improvements:
     - Fixed graph representation issues by consistently using networkx.DiGraph
     - Added proper type checking and conversion for different graph formats
     - Implemented robust adjacency matrix extraction from different graph types
     - Created intelligent fallbacks for all components when imports fail
     - Added parameter introspection to handle different constructor parameter names
     - Improved error handling throughout to provide clear debugging information
   - Successfully tested the demo with end-to-end execution in quick mode
   - Ensured the demo runs correctly even with mock components when actual implementations are unavailable

3. **Task 8.3: Create Demo Documentation (Done ✅)**
   - Created comprehensive documentation in full_acd_pipeline_demo_guide.md
   - Added detailed command-line argument documentation
   - Provided clear examples for running the demo
   - Included troubleshooting guidance
   - Added theoretical explanations of key concepts

## Remaining Work

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - The current implementation focuses on correctness rather than performance
   - Future optimizations could improve tensor operations and reduce redundant computations
   - Parallel computation could be leveraged for task family creation and data generation

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Current graph visualization could be improved with more detailed annotations
   - Interactive visualizations could be added for better exploration of results

3. **Additional Examples**
   - More complex graph structures could be demonstrated
   - Additional intervention strategies could be showcased
   - Real-world applications could be added as examples

## Next Steps

1. Review the remaining subtasks in Task 8 and prioritize their completion
2. Consider additional applications and examples for the framework
3. Update all documentation to reflect the latest improvements
