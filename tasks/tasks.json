For the `has_path` method in `CausalGraph`, implement it using depth-first search:\n```python\ndef has_path(self, source, target):\n    \"\"\"Check if there's a path from source to target node.\"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    def dfs(node):\n        if node == target:\n            return True\n        visited.add(node)\n        for neighbor in self.get_children(node):\n            if neighbor not in visited and dfs(neighbor):\n                return True\n        return False\n    return dfs(source)\n```\n\n2. For edge addition safety, implement a transitive closure check:\n```python\ndef can_add_edge_safely(graph, u, v):\n    # Direct check - avoid self-loops and existing edges\n    if u == v or v in graph.get_children(u):\n        return False\n    # Cycle check - if v can reach u, adding edge u->v creates cycle\n    return not graph.has_path(v, u)\n```\n\n3. For determining modification count based on variation_strength:\n```python\ndef calculate_modifications(graph, variation_strength):\n    node_count = len(graph.nodes)\n    edge_count = sum(len(graph.get_children(n)) for n in graph.nodes)\n    # Scale modifications based on graph size and variation_strength (0.0-1.0)\n    max_possible = min(node_count * (node_count - 1) // 2 - edge_count, edge_count)\n    return max(1, int(max_possible * variation_strength))\n```\n\n4. Add integration test with networkx validation:\n```python\ndef test_structure_variation_preserves_dag():\n    base_graph = CausalGraph(...)  # Create base graph\n    variants = generate_task_family(base_graph, num_variants=5, variation_strength=0.3)\n    \n    for variant in variants:\n        # Convert to networkx for cycle detection\n        nx_graph = nx.DiGraph()\n        for node in variant.nodes:\n            nx_graph.add_node(node)\n        for node in variant.nodes:\n            for child in variant.get_children(node):\n                nx_graph.add_edge(node, child)\n        \n        assert nx.is_directed_acyclic_graph(nx_graph), \"Generated graph is not a DAG\"\n```\n</info added on 2025-04-29T15:40:12.352Z>",

Implementing color-coding where added nodes/edges are green, removed are red, and unchanged are blue\n   - `generate_difficulty_heatmap()` creates a seaborn heatmap that:\n     - Maps task variations (x-axis) against difficulty metrics (y-axis)\n     - Supports multiple metrics including 'node_count', 'edge_density', 'longest_path', and 'branching_factor'\n     - Uses a diverging colormap centered on the base task's values\n\n2. **Visualization Customization**:\n   - Added optional parameters for figure size, DPI, and colormap selection\n   - Implemented `save_to_file()` method supporting PNG, PDF, and SVG formats\n   - Added `plot_difficulty_progression()` method that shows how difficulty increases across variations\n\n3. **TaskFamily Class Foundation**:\n   - Implemented core data structure with:\n     ```python\n     class TaskFamily:\n         def __init__(self, base_task, variations=None, metadata=None):\n             self.base_task = base_task\n             self.variations = variations or []\n             self.metadata = metadata or {}\n             self._difficulty_cache = {}\n         \n         def add_variation(self, variation, variation_type, parameters):\n             # Stores variation with its generation metadata\n             variation_info = {\n                 'graph': variation,\n                 'type': variation_type,\n                 'parameters': parameters,\n                 'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()\n             }\n             self.variations.append(variation_info)\n     ```\n\n4. **Test Implementation**:\n   -

Identify any missing methods or functionality that need to be implemented\n5. Create a detailed report of findings, including a plan for extending the class if needed\n\nTesting approach: No direct testing needed for this subtask as it's analytical, but create a checklist of requirements to validate in later subtasks.\n\n<info added on 2025-04-29T17:34:53.282Z>\nWhen reviewing the StructuralCausalModel implementation, pay special attention to these technical details:\n\n1. **Method Naming Discrepancy**: Note that the required method `perform_intervention(node, value, n_samples)` is actually implemented as `do_intervention(target, value)` followed by `sample_data(sample_size)`, or as the combined `sample_interventional_data(interventions_dict, sample_size)`.\n\n2. **Adjacency Matrix Access**: The required `get_adjacency_matrix()` method isn't directly exposed in StructuralCausalModel. You'll need to either:\n   - Access it through `_causal_graph.get_adjacency_matrix()`\n   - Create a wrapper method in your extension\n   - Use the NetworkX conversion via `to_networkx()` followed by NetworkX's adjacency matrix functions\n\n3. **Implementation Location**: The core implementation is in `causal_meta/environments/scm.py`, with the CausalGraph class in `causal_meta/graph/causal_graph.py` and DirectedGraph in `causal_meta/graph/directed_graph.py`.\n\n4. **Method Signatures**:\n   - `sample_data(sample_size, include_latents=False, squeeze=True, as_array=True, seed=None)`\n   - `do_intervention(target, value)`\n   - `sample_interventional_data(interventions_dict, sample_size, include_latents=False, squeeze=True, as_array=True, seed=None)`\n\n5. **State Management**: Check how the class maintains state between interventions and how `reset()` restores the original model state.\n</info added on 2025-04-29T17:34:53.282Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-29T19:50:15.885Z>\nWhen analyzing the StructuralCausalModel implementation, focus on these critical implementation details:\n\n1. **Internal Data Structures**: The SCM uses a combination of:\n   - `_structural_equations`: Dictionary mapping node names to callable functions\n   - `_noise_distributions`: Dictionary mapping node names to noise distribution objects\n   - `_causal_graph`: CausalGraph object representing the DAG structure\n\n2. **Noise Handling**: Examine how noise is generated and incorporated into the structural equations. The class supports both parametric distributions and empirical noise sampling.\n\n3. **Intervention Implementation**: The intervention mechanism works by:\n   - Creating a copy of the structural equations dictionary\n   - Replacing target node's equation with a constant function returning the intervention value\n   - Maintaining this modified state until reset() is called\n\n4. **Performance Considerations**: For large sample sizes, check if vectorized operations are used for efficiency or if sampling is done sequentially.\n\n5. **API Consistency**: Note inconsistencies in parameter naming between methods (e.g., `sample_size` vs `n_samples`, `random_seed` vs `seed`), which may require standardization in your extension.\n\n6. **Dependencies**: The implementation relies on NetworkX for graph operations and NumPy/SciPy for numerical computations, which should be preserved in your extension.\n</info added on 2025-04-29T19:50:15.885Z>",

However, we can enhance it with:\n\n### Optimization Opportunities\n- Consider vectorizing operations for large sample sizes using NumPy's broadcasting capabilities\n- Add caching for deterministic nodes with no parents to avoid redundant calculations\n\n### Error Handling Improvements\n- Add validation for negative sample sizes\n- Implement graceful handling of cyclic dependencies (currently would cause infinite loops)\n- Add checks for undefined structural equations\n\n### Extension Points\n- Support for parallel sampling when n_samples is very large\n- Add an optional progress bar for large sample sizes\n- Implement a `sample_data_interventional` variant that allows for do-interventions during sampling\n\n### Example Usage\n```python\n# Example of using the existing method with interventions\nscm = StructuralCausalModel(...)\n# Normal sampling\nobs_data = scm.sample_data(1000)\n# For interventional data, we would need to implement:\n# int_data = scm.sample_data_interventional(1000, interventions={'X': lambda n: np.ones(n)})\n```\n</info added on 2025-04-29T17:35:23.068Z>",

Import the TaskFamily class alongside StructuralCausalModel:\n   ```python\n   from causalforge.models import StructuralCausalModel\n   from causalforge.core import TaskFamily\n   ```\n\n2. Wrap your causal graph in a TaskFamily object before passing to StructuralCausalModel:\n   ```python\n   # Create base DAG (using networkx or other library)\n   G = nx.DiGraph()\n   G.add_edges_from([('X', 'Y'), ('Z', 'Y')])\n   \n   # Wrap in TaskFamily\n   task_family = TaskFamily(name=\"example_family\", base_graph=G)\n   \n   # Initialize SCM with TaskFamily\n   scm = StructuralCausalModel(task_family=task_family)\n   ```\n\n3.
